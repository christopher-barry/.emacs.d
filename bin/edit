# Run emacsclient if a server is running
# otherwise start emacs, which intializes
# the server in .emacs as "(server)". You'll need
# to add that to your .emacs separately.

# set EDITOR=/path/to/this/script
# to use this method of launching emacs from mc
# which will not block mc, allowing multiple files
# to be open in the editor at once from mc.

# also make this script the executable in your
# emacs.desktop file. I like to put the following:
# exec /path/to/edit --create-frame
# this has the result of opening a new window, but still
# uses the same emacs instance.
